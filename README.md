DataQuest Guided Project - Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, I'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

population - The population as of 2015.
population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
area - The total land and water area.

In this guided project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze data from this database.
